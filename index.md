### EXPERIENCE

   **Machine Learning Engineer II** | **Comcast** | **Chennai, TN** | **July 2022 - Present**

      * AI For Connected Living
        * Developed audio signature classifier using YAMNet to classify audio from camera and notify Xfinity customers.
        * Built XGboost model on image features (blob size, skewness, entropy, intensity statistics, SSIM) to classify IR
        images with over exposure.
        * Implemented a object state detector using MobileNetV2 and CLIP embedding for various doorways.
        * Primary for Object Detection Model in production. Captured 500 errors using shadow deployment and resolved
        them.
      * Generative AI
        * Developed a RAG application that helps technicians to get answers to queries bounded to technical manuals.
        * Used OpenAI’s Embedding for converting documents chunks to embeddings and stored them in ChromaDB.
        * Used OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 API for accurate response generation and deployed the application on ECS with a
        streamlit interface.
        * Extended it with a reranker for retriver and implemented a semantic cache to reduce API cost.
        * Finetuned LLama2 7B Instruct Model for Logs analysis. Performed PEFT using Lora and updated weights of 0.3% parameters for better response.
      * Media Analytics
        * Improved clustering accuracy by adding functionality to upload new faces to elasticsearch and enrich milvusDB.
        Finetuned facial parameters for more meaningful face detection.
        * Implemented a intro/outro detection for TV shows using PANN model and audio references.
      * AIOps Initiatives
        * Implemented deepant and prophet models for anamoly detection of logs along with kubeflow pipelines for
        automated training and deployment. Performed scaling and performance testing on the endpoint.
        * Implemented multiprocessing for scheduling parallel training of 100’s of models.

   **Graduate Research** | **Indian Statistical Institute** | **Kolkata, WB** | **June 2021 - July 2022**

      * Developed a StyleGAN based model for image generation with wasserstein loss for style transfer task, trained it on COCO dataset, and compared to model using traditional GAN loss, under the guidance of prof. Ujjwal Bhattacharya.

   **Business Analyst Intern** | **Kofluence** | **Bangalore** | **July 2020 - September 2020**

      * Implemented ensemble classifier models on YouTube data to predict channel engagement and identify potential influencers.
      * Implemented YouTube data scraping tool.

   **Engineering Management Trainee** | **ITC Limited (Hotels Division)** | **New Delhi** | **Oct. 2018 - Aug 2019**

   **Summer Trainee** | **Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited** | **Hyderabad** | **June 2016 - July 2016**

### Projects

  **Mother’s Day tweet Sentiment Analysis .**
    * Implemeted attention based BiLSTM to predicted sentiment of Mother’s Day Tweets as positive, neutral, negative.
    * Achieved an accuracy of 99% compared to BiLSTM model without attention which has accuracy of 71%.

  **Image Captioning with Local Attention .**
    * Implemeted attention based image captioning with VGG16 and LSTM as encoder with bahdanau attention and trained on Flickr8k Dataset.
