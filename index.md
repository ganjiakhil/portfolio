### EXPERIENCE

   **Machine Learning Engineer II** | **Comcast** | **Chennai, TN** | **July 2022 - Present**

      * AI For Connected Living Tasks focused on data from indoor and doorbell cameras
        * Developed audio signature classification model using YAMNet to classify audio from camera to certain classes such as dog bark, smoke alarm, babycry and notify Xfinity customers.
        * Implemented an XGBoost model to classify cameras that are facing over exposure issue in night mode. Extracted Image features like blob size, skewness, entropy, mode and standard deviation of intensity, ssim score with day mode frame.
        * Implemented a POC using MobileNet V2 and CLIP embedding to use camera to detect the change in state of objects like window, fridge door, garage door using bounding box regions from Xfinity user.
        * To resolve the 500 error returned by Object Detection API in production. Performed Shadow Deployment to capture inputs causing error, resolved the Image read issue and then deployed the image using canary deployment.

      * Generative AI
        * Implemented a RAG based model that enables technicians to obtain answers to queries without the need to consult to technical manuals or assistance.
        * Used Langchain and OpenAl's Embedding API for efficient chunking of technical manuals and converting chunks to embeddings.
        * Integrated OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API for accurate response generation and deployed the application on ECS with a streamlit interface.

      * Celebrity Recognition
        * Conducted parameter tuning for face parameters to capture more meaningful faces for clustering and identifying celebrity. Implemented Streamlit Dashboard to upload images of new celebrities to elasticSearch which will be used in addition to milvus Vector DB for improved identification of new evaluation celebrities.
        * Implemented a POC using PANN model for detecting intro/outro segments of a show using audio references.

      * MLOps Initiatives
        * Implemented Kubeflow pipelines for an anamoly detection model for data processing, training, evaluation and deployment. Performed scaling and performance testing on the endpoint.
        * Implemented Single Sign-On for OIDC login on Kubeflow using Amazon Cognito.

   **Graduate Research** | **Indian Statistical Institute** | **Kolkata, WB** | **June 2021 - July 2022**

      * Developed a StyleGAN based model for image generation with wasserstein loss for style transfer task, trained it on COCO dataset, and compared to model using traditional GAN loss, under the guidance of prof. Ujjwal Bhattacharya.
      * Developed an attention based BiLSTM for aspect-based sentiment analysis of tweets, under guidance of prof. Debapriyo.

   **Business Analyst Intern** | **Kofluence** | **Bangalore** | **July 2020 - September 2020**

      * Implemented ensemble classifier models on YouTube data to predict channel engagement and identify potential influencers.
      * Implemented YouTube data scraping tool.

   **Engineering Management Trainee** | **ITC Limited (Hotels Division)** | **New Delhi** | **Oct. 2018 - Aug 2019**

   **Summer Trainee** | **Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited** | **Hyderabad** | **June 2016 - July 2016**
